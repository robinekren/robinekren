The coordination of team members is just as crucial as the strategies in the game. The <strong>tools and software</strong> he uses are <strong>like the classes</strong>, each serving a specific role to help succeed. The more you invest your time and energy, the better you become at <strong>mastering the game</strong>, and in business, the same applies.</p>
