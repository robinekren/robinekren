                        <p>Robin Ekren once said, <strong>running a business</strong> is very much like <strong>playing a game</strong>. The coordination of team members is just as crucial as the strategies in the game. The <strong>tools and software</strong> he uses are <strong>like the classes</strong>, each serving a specific role to help succeed. The more you invest your time and energy, the better you become at <strong>mastering the game</strong>, and in business, the same applies.</p>

                        <p>But life wasn't always easy. Robin faced tough challenges, even spending some time living on the streets, struggling to find his path. Despite everything, he held onto his dream, <strong>finished school</strong> through evening classes, and eventually <strong>found Instagram marketing</strong>.</p>
                        
                        <p>Instagram became his lifeline, a place where he could express his creativity and <strong>build communities</strong>. Those early struggles <strong>shaped his strength</strong> and drive, pushing him to help others dream big and find success, even in the hardest times.</p>

                        <p>Robin Ekren discovered his passion for online marketing when he began using Instagram marketing. <strong>With a vision</strong> to share his knowledge and <strong>build a community</strong>, Robin started creating content that quickly helped him gain thousands of followers.

                        <p>After years of refining and experimenting, Robin realized that Instagram was not just a platform for personal success, but a valuable business <strong>opportunity</strong>.

These courses grew rapidly, propelling him to a successful career as an <strong>Instagram expert</strong>.</p>
                        
                        <p><strong>But Robin wanted more:</strong> he wanted to <strong>create a system</strong> that would help other entrepreneurs succeed as well. He founded Eko University, a platform that <strong>not only</strong> shares knowledge but empowers participants to <strong>scale it</strong> and make it profitable in the long run.</p>
